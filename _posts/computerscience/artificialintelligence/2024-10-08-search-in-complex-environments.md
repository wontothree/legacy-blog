# 1. Local Search and Optimization Problems

Local search algorithms operate by searching from a start state to neighboring states without keeping track of the paths, nor the set of states that have been reached.

[Disadvantage]

That means they are not systematic - they might never explore a portion of the search space where a solution actually resides.

[Advantage]

1. they use very little memory
2. they can often find reasonable solutions in large or infinite state spaces for which systematic algorithms are unsuitable.
