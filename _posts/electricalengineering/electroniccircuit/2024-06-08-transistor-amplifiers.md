We study

- The models that are used to represent both transistor types in tha analysis and design of small-signal linear amplifiers
- The three basic configurations in which each of the two transistor types can be connected to create an amplifier

## 1. Basic Principles

## 2. Small-Signal Operatoin and Models

## 3. Basic Configuration

## 4. Biasing

## 5. Discrete-Circuit Amplifiers

### 5.1 A common-Source (SC) Amplifier

### 5.2 A Common-Emitter Amplifier

### 5.3 A Common-Emitter Amplifier with an Emitter Resistance $R_e$

### 5.4 A Common-Base (CB) Amplifier

### 5.5 An Emitter Follower

### 5.6 The Amplifier Frequency Response
