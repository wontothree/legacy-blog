## 1. Basics of Counting

A wide variety of counting problems will be introduces in this section

>**The Product Rule** \
>Suppose that a procedure can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks. If there are $n_1$ ways to do the first task and for each of these ways of doing the first task, there are $n_2$ ways to do the second task, then there are $n_1n_2$ ways to do the procedure.

>**The Sum Rule** \
>If a task can be done either in one of $n_1$ ways or in one of $n_2$ ways, where none of the set of $n_1$ ways is the same as any of the set of $n_2$ ways, then there are $n_1 + n_2$ ways to do the task.

### 1.4 Substracting Rule (Inclusion-Exclusion for Two Sets)

>**The Subtraction Rule** \
>If a task can be done in either $n_1$ ways or $n_2$ ways, then the number of ways to do the task is $n_1 + n_2$ minus the number of ways to do the task that are common to the two different ways.

### 1.5 The Division Rule

>**The Division Rule** \
>There are $n/d$ ways to do a task if it can be done using a procedure that can be carried out in $n$ ways, and for every way $w$, exactly $d$ of the $n$ ways correspond to way $w$.

## 2. The Pigeonhole Principle

>**[Theorem 1] The Pigeonhole Principle** \
>If $k$ is a positive integer and $k+1$ or more objects are placed into $k$ boxes, then there is at least on box containing two or more of the objects.
